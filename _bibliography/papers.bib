	abstract = {This study describes a detailed numerical model of large diameter finned tube heat exchangers for a dry-cooled supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) Brayton cycle. Multiple-row heat exchangers are discretised into two-dimensional cells, and physical properties and heat transfer coefficients are evaluated locally at each cell to account for the large changes in sCO2 properties near the critical point. Air-flow is modelled as either forced draft, or natural draft within a natural draft dry cooling tower (NDDCT) model. Conditions anticipated for sCO2 Recompression cycle heat rejection are used to determine the heat exchanger area required for the cycle. The influence of different correlations for sCO2-side heat transfer is studied, showing that up to 27\% more heat exchange area is predicted using generic-fluid heat transfer correlations when compared to those developed specifically for sCO2. The model is used to determine the effect of design ambient temperature on the heat exchanger size, as well as heat exchanger performance at elevated off-design ambient temperatures. Criteria for the presence of buoyancy effects in sCO2 flow from literature are shown to be exceeded by an order of magnitude under the conditions modelled, demonstrating that uncertainty remains regarding of the behaviour of sCO2 heat transfer under these conditions.},

	abstract = {The supercritical CO 2 recompression cycle (the 'sCO 2 cycle') is highly efficient, scalable, simple, and compatible with dry cooling. Two scenarios where dry-cooled sCO 2 cycles may operate off design are (1) during periods of high ambient temperature, and (2) when operating at part-load output (in load-following roles). Understanding sCO 2 cycle off-design performance is essential for financial feasibility assessment, detailed design, and providing control system setpoints. Off-design performance can be maximised by exploiting the cycle's pressure, temperature , and turbomachinery speed degrees of freedom. Several previous studies arbitrarily constrain these degrees of freedom, giving sub-optimal performance predictions. Other studies fail to consider CO 2 's steep and non-linear property variations, leading to inaccurate results. To address these limitations, this work presents a detailed sCO 2 cycle model, which captures property changes and component off-design behaviour. The model is used to systematically explore the off-design operating space, thus showing novel off-design performance trends and best operating strategies. Elevated ambient temperatures reduce power output more than efficiency, but this effect can be mitigated with appropriate operating strategies. At an ambient temperature of 40 • C (10 • C above design), design-point power output can be maintained with an 8.7\% minimum turbine pressure increase, alongside compressor speed control. Alternatively, at this same temperature, design-point power output can be maintained with only a 4.4\% (2 percentage point) efficiency reduction and a slightly higher (13.7\%) turbine pressure increase. During turn-down, design-point efficiency can be maintained at 44\% of design-point power output by using pressure and compressor speed control. Main compressor speed control alone is effective for above-design ambient temperatures, while dual compressor speed control provides significant benefits during turn-down. Compared to past sCO 2 cycle studies, this work reports better off-design performance, which demonstrates the importance of off-design operating strategies and highlights the flexibility and potential of the cycle.},

	abstract = {Dynamical systems representing vehicle flight are inherently nonlinear. Currently there are no generalised frameworks for explicit characterisation and solution of such systems. Conversely, linear systems are well understood, and many efficient algorithms are available for explicit characterisation and prediction.

Koopman operator theory presents a framework for constructing finite linear approximations to nonlinear systems, by projecting the nonlinear dynamics onto a Hilbert space constructed of Koopman operator eigenfunctions. This work summarises the theory underpinning the Galerkin method of constructing Koopman linear approximations of known dynamics using polynomial basis functions. Details of a system-agnostic program for computing the Koopman linear matrix is presented.

Linear approximations are constructed for two nonlinear systems: a simple Duffing oscillator, and a three degree-of-freedom glider trajectory. The ability of linear systems to closely follow the time-integrated nonlinear solution is demonstrated. Furthermore, expansions of the lifted linear model to incorporate variable system parameter, to incorporate bilinear time-varying inputs necessary for optimal control calculations, as well as methods to avoid the inherent linear system limitations are explored.

This work demonstrates feasibility and merit of the lifted linear system approach for analysis of vehicle dynamics and trajectory problems.},
