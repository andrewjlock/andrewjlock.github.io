I'm a mechanical engineer with a wide range of experience spanning thermo-fluid systems, power generation, hypersonics, and dynamical systems. 
I frequently develop and use open-source numerical models to predict, analyse, and optimise the physical world. I also plan and perform experiments such as hypersonic wind tunnel tests, airborne satellite re-entry observations, and small scale experimental power cycles.

I'm interested in all things energy, aerospace, and numerical modelling of physical systems (especially those with moving parts).

**Background** \
After finishing my undergraduate engineering degree in my home town of Hobart, Australia, I spent two years working on natural gas infrastructure. 
Wanting a greater challenge, I then completed my PhD at the University of Queensland, Australia focussing on thermo-fluid modelling of power cycles, complex-fluid heat transfer, and the broader energy sector.
I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research fellow in the Hypersonics and Rocketry group at the University of Southern Queensland, lead by Professor David Buttsworth. 
Along the way I've provided teaching assistance to a large number of university courses, and been involved in many projects with various industry partners.
