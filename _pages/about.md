I'm fortunate enough to have worked in a variety of areas spanning thermo-fluid systems, power generation, hypersonics, dynamical systems, and numerical modelling. I develop and use 
open-source (predominantly Python) modelling tools every day, and have also worked on 
some fascinating experiments such as hypersonic wind tunnel testing, airborne satellite re-entry observations, and small scale super-critical fluid power cycles.

My professional journey started with an undergraduate engineering degree in my
home town of Hobart, Australia, followed by two years working on natural
gas infrastructure. Needing more of a challenge, I then completed my PhD at the 
University of Queensland, Australia focussing on thermo-fluid modelling of power cycles 
and complex-fluid heat transfer. Now I'm a Postdoctoral Research fellow at the University 
of Southern Queensland. Along the way I've provided teaching assistance to a large number of
university courses, and been involved in many projects with various industry partners.

I'm interested in all things energy, aerospace, and numerical modelling of
physical systems (especially those with moving parts).
