I'm a mechanical engineer with experience in thermo-fluid systems, power generation, hypersonics, dynamical systems, and optimisation. 
I write open-source code models, and plan and conduct experiments.
I am currently a Postdoctoral Research fellow in the Hypersonics and Rocketry group at the University of Southern Queensland. 
<!--Noteworthy projects include trajectory reconstruction of NASA'sa-->
<!---->
<!--including hypersonic wind tunnel tests, amospheric re-entry measurements, rocket launch measurements, and prototyping novel small scale power cycles.-->
<!--I'm interested in all things energy, aerospace, and numerical modelling of physical systems (especially those with moving parts).-->

<!--**Background** \-->
<!--After finishing my undergraduate engineering degree in my home town of Hobart, Australia, I first worked in the industry for three years first as a consultant, and then designin new compressed natural plants for an asset owner. -->
<!--Following this I then completed my PhD at the University of Queensland, Australia, with a focus on thermo-fluid modelling of power cycles, complex-fluid heat transfer, and the broader energy sector.-->
<!--Along the way I've provided teaching assistance to a large number of university courses, and been involved in many projects with various industry partners.-->
