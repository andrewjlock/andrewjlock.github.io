There's lots to learn from taking measurements of objects as they re-enter the
earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds (and extremely hot temperatures).

My colleagues focus on spectroscopy, while I focus on position and trajectory
reconstruction and triangulation.

In September 2024 we joined NASA in Salt Lake City to observe the re-entry of NASA's
OSIRIS-REx satellite. Stay tuned for results and publications!
